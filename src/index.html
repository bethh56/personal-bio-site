    <p class="bioInfo mx-5 px-2">Hello! My name is Beth. During the day, I am an Ophthalmic Technician. In my evenings, I am learning what it takes to be a software developer at Nashville Software School. <br><br> I didn’t know much about the world of software development but knew I wanted to find ways to further progress myself.  After exploring and talking with some friends in the field, I decided to take an introduction course into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  In such a short period of time, I felt like I learned and grew more than I thought was even possible!  I knew that this would be a career that would never bore me and constantly offer growth opportunities. <br><br> At this current point, I’m enjoying tackling my weekly assignments and seeing the progress I’ve made throughout the time I have been at Nashville Software School.  I find it very rewarding when I am able to solve a problem in my code and learn something new in the process.  I also find it rewarding to see my work come to life on a webpage.
